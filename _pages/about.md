I am currently a Ph.D. student at National University of Singapore, under supervison of Professor [Leong Tze-Yun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leongty/index.html). Besides, I am also working with Professor [Arnab Bhattacharyya](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~arnab/) as a research assistant. My research interests include causal inference, causal discovery, point processes, Hawkes processes.
