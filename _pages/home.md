## About
<!-- ======-->
I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the School of Computing - National University of Singapore (NUS), working with Professors <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leongty/" target="_blank">Leong Tze Yun</a> and <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~arnab/" target="_blank">Arnab Bhattacharyya</a>. My research interests include causal inference, causal discovery, and point processes.

I completed my PhD in computer science at the NUS on problems related to causal inference from observational data. I was advised by Professor <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leongty/" target="_blank">Leong Tze Yun</a>.
